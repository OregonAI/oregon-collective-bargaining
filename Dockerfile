#
# BUILD FROM A SHALLOW CLONE, not your working tree. `.git` cannot be excluded — it is a
# RUNTIME dependency, because the FTS cache key is `git rev-parse HEAD` plus a hash of
# `git status --porcelain`, and corpus_overview() shells out to `git log -1`. A depth-1
# clone keeps git working and the image small:
#
#   git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/OregonAI/oregon-collective-bargaining build/
#   docker build -t oregon-collective-bargaining-mcp build/
#
# HYBRID/API ARCHETYPES need NETWORK EGRESS at runtime for their live half. Keep the
# degradation HONEST: an upstream outage must report upstream_status: "unavailable",
# never render as a zero (see oregon-budget's Dockerfile and tests/test_hybrid.py for
# the precedent and the reasoning). A document corpus can delete this paragraph.

# --path and --public-hostname both matter behind the tunnel and are easy to omit:
#   * A Cloudflare Tunnel matches on path but does NOT strip it. Routing /oregon-collective-bargaining
#     here forwards the whole path, so the server must mount at that same prefix or
#     every request 404s.
#   * Without --public-hostname the SDK's DNS-rebinding guard rejects the forwarded Host
#     header with 421 Invalid Host header.
# Override either at `docker run` for a different hostname or a dedicated-host
# deployment (in which case pass --path /mcp).
